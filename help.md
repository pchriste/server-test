# DESCRIPTION


The `dynatrace/oneagent` image provides the Dynatrace OneAgent component of the [Dynatrace SaaS and Managed](https://www.dynatrace.com/technologies/cloud-and-microservices/docker-monitoring/) platform for all-in-one, real user experience and full-stack application and container monitoring. Please find detailed information in our [online help](https://help.dynatrace.com/monitor-cloud-virtualization-and-hosts/hosts/how-do-i-deploy-dynatrace-as-docker-container/).


# USAGE


The `dynatrace/oneagent` image is designed to be run by the atomic `run` command:


```
atomic run dynatrace/oneagent \
  TENANT={my-tenant} \
  TENANT_TOKEN={my-tenant-token} \
  SERVER=https://{my-tenant}.live.dynatrace.com
```


Be sure to replace TENANT and TENANT_TOKEN with your environment’s actual values. This starts the container with selected privileges to the host and with the root directory bind mounted inside the container to install Dynatrace OneAgent on the host.


# LABELS


The `dynatrace/onagent` container includes the following LABEL settings:


That atomic command runs the docker command set in this label:


`RUN`=docker run -d --privileged --name NAME --ipc=host --net=host --pid=host -v /:/mnt/root IMAGE


The contents of the RUN label tells an `atomic run dynatrace/oneagent` command to open various privileges to the host (described later), mount the root directory into the container, set the name of the container and run the Dynatrace OneAgent installation.

# SECURITY IMPLICATIONS


The `dynatrace/oneagent` container is what is referred to as a super-privileged container. It is designed to have almost complete access to the host system as root user. The following docker command options open selected privileges to the host:


`-d`


Runs continuously as a daemon process in the background.


`--privileged`


Turns off security separation, so a process running as root in the container would have the same access to the host as it would if it were run directly on the host.


`--ipc=host`


Allows processes run inside the container to directly access the host’s IPC namespace.


`--net=host`


Allows processes run inside the container to directly access host network interfaces.


`--pid=host`


Allows processes run inside the container to see and work with all processes in the host process table.
